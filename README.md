This is a project I created for a Creative Coding class. This project is a basic side scrolling shooting game programmed in p5js. I used object oriented programming as well as the p5play library to create the characters. [This](http://openprocessing.org/sketch/1031071) is the link to the project on openprocessing if it does not run locally.
